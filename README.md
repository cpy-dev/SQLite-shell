# Installation

Download teh .deb file corresponding with your system

Before trying to execute the application, it is needed to run "setup.sh": it installs the needed dependencies and allows sqliteshell.sh to be executed.

On some systems, it is required to get permission to execute setup.sh. This is the command for doing that:
    
    $ sudo chmod +x setup.sh

After the setup execution, you can execute sqliteshell.sh and use SQLite Shell
